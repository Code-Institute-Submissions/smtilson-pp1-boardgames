                <p class="ccontainer content box">The game Lost Cities is a great 2 player game by Reiner Knizia.
                    It is elegant in its simplicity. It is, however, a brutal game
                    that will have you cursing your opponent. Me and my wife have
                    fun playing this, even though she regularly trounces me! There
                    is lots of "push your luck" in this game, so beware if you are a
                    fan of "perfect information".

                <h3 class="content-header box">Fox in the Forest</h3>
                <p class="container content box">Fox in the Forest is a lovely 2 player trick taking game. And they said
                    it couldn't be done! It mixes special powers on the odd cards with a strange scoring system to
                    create a lot of tension throughout each hand and the whole game overall. The special abilities are
                    easy to remember, eventhough they are written on the cards. You have to always be flexible and
                    willing to change your strategy on a dime. It can be a very tight competition between players. I
                    used to think I was quite good at this game until my brother beat me solidly the first two times he
                    played. I still love it though.

                <p class="container content box">This adaptation of the modern classic 7 Wonders to two players is
                    considered superior to its predecessor by many. It is highly ranked on BGG, and for good reason.
                    This tableau builder sees you working through 3 different ages with progressively more powerful
                    cards. The main hurdle in devloping a two player variant was in how to implement drafting for only
                    two players. This was masterfully done by Bruno Cathala, and gave him the reputation of being the
                    king of 2 player variants. There are many roads to victory and different special abilities
                    throughout the game. One tip, don't underestimate science!
