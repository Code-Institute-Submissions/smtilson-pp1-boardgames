                <p class="container content box">Arkham Horror: the Card Game is the prototypical living card game
                    (regular release cycle of new content). It is best thought of as a boardgame made of cards. Very
                    similar to a role-playing game, your deck of cards acts as your charaacter with different items,
                    abilities, and actions. The theme of the game is dark, and sees you often failing. But don't worry,
                    losing is fun, as they say. The game constantly pushes the frontier of narrative games with emergent
                    story. There is a ton of content for this game and Fantasy Flight Games does not appear to be
                    slowing down.

                <h3 class="content-header box">Heat: Pedal to the Metal</h3>
                <p class="container content box"> Heat is a racing game that truly feels fast. You play as a racecar
                    driver playing cards from your to race around the track. The teach can be
                    intimidating as each turn has many steps, but after one lap you are sure to get the hang of it.
                    Winner of the Dice Towers "Game of the Year" award for 2022, it is engaging for all levels of gamer.
                    The game comes with tournament mode, advanced weather cards, parts for racecar customization, and
                    rules for "AI" players. One downside of the production is that the box leaves room for two more
                    player pieces which are not included. To be able to play with eight people, you will need to
                    purchase both upcoming expansions.

                <h3 class="content-header box">Earthborne Rangers</h3>
                <p class="container content box">Earthborne Rangers is the first game from brand new publisher
                    Earthborne Games. It had a successful kickstarter and a <strong>very</strong> successful Gamefound
                    campaign for its second printing and new expansions. It is an open world adventure game in the
                    style, but not theme, of Arkhom Horror: the Card Game. The team behind it even includes former
                    employees (in particular former Head of Studio Andrew Navarro) from Fantasy Flight Games. The team
                    knocked it completely out of the park with this optimistic view of the future. They have even
                    managed to snag MJ Newman (codesigner for Arkham Horror: the Card Game). I can't wait to see what is
                    in store for us.
