                <p class="container content box">Century: Spice Road is the first in a trilogy of games from Emerson
                    Matsuuchi. It is an engine building game where you either buy cards from an auction row, play cards
                    to collect or exchange spices, or purchase victory cards with the spices you have collected. It is a
                    fast paced and highly accessible game that has been favorably compared to the very popular Splendor.
                    Unlike Splendor, it is not tight and is welcoming to players new to the hobby. There are few rules
                    to remember and you can glean all of them simply by looking at the components. It can be combined
                    with other games in the trilogy, which makes for a ery interesting prospect.

                <h3 class="content-header box">Onitama</h3>
                <p class="container content box">Onitama is an abstract two player strategy game in the spirit of chess.
                    The twist is that the allowable moves change from turn to turn as you pass cards between yourself
                    and your oponent. The game is easy to pick up, but unsurprisingly hard to master. You have complete
                    information and so much of your strategy comes from restricitng the moves of your opponent. It plays
                    quickly enough that you can set up and play again. It comes with 16 move cards, and so each game can
                    feel quite different as it sees you using only five of these cards.

                <p class="container content box">Sagrada is a dice drafting game. You have a field with certain
                    restrictions and you gradually fill it with colored diceto "create a stained glass masterpiece". At
                    the end, you score your field based on different criteria, some public and some private. Games can
                    be high scoring and very close. There are also limited special actions for an extra twist. The game
                    is straightforward and accessible.
