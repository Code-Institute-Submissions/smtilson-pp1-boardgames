## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
### Project Description
This site is a collection of recommendations for different boardgames and cardgames for people new to the hobby. There are pages devoted to 2 player games, games for new players, and the authors personal favorite games. Information on specific games is accompanied by links to relevant external sites. 
<!-- the below feaeture has not let been added. It will likely be the last feature, if at all.
There is also a page of links to external resources relevant to the hobby.

### Project Purpose
The purpose of the site is to inform people new to the hobby about different games they may not be aware of. Not every game suits every person/group of players, and the site aims to help people make informed choices. Hundreds of new boardgames are released every year as the hobby and market grows. Providing information about games for different audiences is a valuable endeavor as the hobby can be expensive and time consuming.

### User Demographics
The expected user is someone who has some experience with hobby boardgames and cardgames. They are interested in trying new games and determining what they do and do not like.

### Future directions
The site does not have information on that many games, but the design is such that it can be extended to include details of many other games.

## Features <a name="features"></a>
#### Navbar
There is a navbar at the top of the page. For screens of width less than 768px, the navbar is hidden. Clicking on the header of the page will toggle the navbar, which drops down below the header.

On larger screens, it displays horizontally beneath the header. Also, the current page is highlighted and hovering over an item will cause it to be underlined.

#### Footer
The footer contains (so far) links to social media sites. These open in new tabs and only go to the main page of the respective social media site. The links are social media icons.

#### Content pages
So far, there are 3 pages of content. They each relate to a different (but potentially overlapping) category of games: games for 2 players, games for new players, and the authors favorite games. Each page contains entries on multiple games. Each entry contains an image of the boardgame cover, a brief blurb about the game from the author, and links to external sites regarding the game.

#### Links to external resources
hese external links are to the games page on BGG (the definitive online resource for boardgames), and reviews on youtube. The primary reviews are to the YouTube channels Shut Up and Sit Down, and the Dice Tower. These are the two most dominant review channels on YouTube.
